  <div class="introduction">
    <h2 style="font-size: 50px; color: rgb(219, 131, 43);">About us</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 28px;">
      DC Studios was founded in <span style="font-weight: bold;">2012</span> by <span
        style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">three brothers</span> who shared a love for
      music and a dream of
      creating a space where independent artists could be heard. Starting with little more than second-hand
      gear and a passion for sound, they built their studio from the ground up. Over time, their reputation
      for personal attention and authentic recordings grew, and they welcomed two more
      dedicated team members to expand their vision. Today, DC Studios remains a tight-knit team of five, proud
      to stand beside small artists and help them bring their voices to life.

    <h2 style="font-size: 50px; color: rgb(219, 131, 43);">Our mission</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 27px;">At DC Studios, we empower small and independent artists by providing a professional
      yet
      personal
      space where creativity, authenticity, and community come together to create big sound from a small team.</p>
